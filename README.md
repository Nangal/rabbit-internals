# RabbitMQ Internals #

This project aims to describe the internal architecture of RabbitMQ. I'm doing it as a way to learn more about Erlang Application Design and also to help others understand how the broker works.

Feel free to fork the project and add your own fixes and improvements to what has been done so far.
